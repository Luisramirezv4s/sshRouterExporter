# sshRouterExporter
A Python tool to connect to Cisco routers via SSH, retrieve interface status information, and export the results to **Excel (.xlsx)** or **SQL (.sql)** formats.  
This project uses **Paramiko** for SSH communication and **OpenPyXL** for Excel file generation.

# Features
- üîë SSH connection to Cisco routers using Paramiko.  
- üåê Executes `show ip interface brief` to retrieve interface details.  
- üìä Export results to:
  - Excel workbook (`.xlsx`)
  - SQL script (`.sql`) for database import.  
- üõ†Ô∏è Simple CLI menu for choosing export formats.

# Environment Setup
This work was carried out in a **virtualized network environment**:  
1. **VMware Fusion** was used as the virtualizer.  
2. **GNS3** (both client and server) was configured to provide a graphical network simulation.  

‚ö†Ô∏è Make sure your GNS3 client and server are properly configured to allow communication between the host machine and the virtualized devices.
